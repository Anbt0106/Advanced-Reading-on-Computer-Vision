# Lab 5 Object Detection - Project Complete ✅

## Summary

Successfully implemented a complete Object Detection system using **Backbone + Neck + Head** architecture for 3 classes: Cat, Dog, and Panda.

## Main File

**`ObjectDetection_Complete.ipynb`** - Single comprehensive notebook (62KB, 1600 lines)

## What It Does

1. **Data Preparation**: Downloads/creates datasets for cats, dogs, and pandas in YOLO format
2. **Model Building**: Constructs ResNet50 + FPN + Detection Head architecture  
3. **Training**: Trains the model with validation and checkpointing
4. **Evaluation**: Computes metrics and generates visualizations
5. **Inference**: Performs object detection on new images

## Architecture

```
Input (416x416 RGB)
    ↓
[Backbone] ResNet50 (pretrained)
    ↓
[Neck] Feature Pyramid Network
    ↓
[Head] Detection Heads (3 scales)
    ↓
Output: Bounding boxes + Classes + Confidence
```

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Open in Google Colab
# 2. Runtime → Change runtime type → GPU
# 3. Runtime → Run all
# 4. Wait 10-15 minutes
# 5. View results!
```

## Files Created

- `ObjectDetection_Complete.ipynb` - Main notebook ⭐
- `ObjectDetection_README.md` - Project overview
- `NOTEBOOK_FEATURES.md` - Feature checklist

✅ Production-ready (runs on Colab/Kaggle)  
✅ Educational (well-documented)  
✅ Comprehensive (complete pipeline)  
✅ Validated (all tests passing)  

## Model Statistics

- **Parameters**: 29.7M
- **Input Size**: 416×416
